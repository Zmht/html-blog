        <p>I hate the right to repair movement. Not only is it completely useless, its mainstream proponents are self-serving, unreasonable, and pandering. In 2024, it seems one cannot watch a single tech YouTube video, read a single tech related Reddit thread, or interact with any online hardware-related media or journalism without the inevitable comment, “Umm, this device is gonna be too hard to repair” or “I’ll be waiting for the iFixit teardown before buying.” The right to repair community is now uncomfortably overlapping with the general technology community, and an epidemic is underway in which greedy, pestering, insidious members of the right to repair cult are infecting those who simply enjoy technology. The worst part of it all is that the right to repair camp is misguided, led by profit-hungry figures such as Louis Rossman, iFixit, and Linus Tech Tips.</p>

	    <p>If a device isn’t fully repairable by an average member of their community (likely a 350-pound, 30-year-old, single male), it is deemed anti-consumer, and any online content reviewing this device will be besieged by comments on how awful the device is and how greedy its makers are. For an average consumer, these comments hold heavy influence on their purchases. Right to repair proponents lead normal citizens to believe that they would be able to repair their iPhone’s smashed back glass or that waterlogged laptop if only it was made “repairable” by its manufacturers! In reality, less than 1 in 5 Americans change their own oil, a statistic suggesting most consumers are far less handy than the average Redditor believes they are. Home-built PCs are likely also a cause of this naivety amongst many “technology nerds.” Let me set one thing straight: building a PC is not hard. Building a PC is easier than cooking a meal from a recipe book. It’s easier than following Google Maps directions to the store. PC component makers have ensured that anyone could build their own PC by following rigid and simple standards. Yet, in the technology world, building your own PC is seen as a patch of honor and a certification that you can fix anything. </p>

	    <p>In reality, most consumer hardware is far more complicated than a home computer tower. To be competitive in the market, phones must be weather sealed and shock-resistant, laptops need to be hyper-compact and lightweight, game consoles have to match the performance of a desktop PC. And everything has to be affordable. These are all design requirements which most consumers would agree make products more enticing. The claim that making repairability a primary design requirement would make the product more desirable in the eyes of its consumers is false. Even so, right to repair says they know what consumers want better than the actual consumers. Billions of dollars of market research from Apple , Samsung, Google, etc. was pointless because all consumers really want is repairability. It’s ok if the next MacBook Pro is twice as thick. And it’s fine if we get rid of the weather sealing on the iPhone 16. Just don’t drop your phone in the water! And if you do, just replace all the internals. It is repairable after all!</p>


	    <p>Right to repair content creators are behind much of this nonsense. Louis Rossman has built a multi-million subscriber YouTube channel by ranting about repairability. His videos attract millions of viewers who listen to him spit accusations at the corporations who produce our devices. iFixit has declared themselves the official governing body of the right to repair movement, placing sponsorships in Linus Tech Tip videos, and selling overpriced tools and parts to members of their cult who are convinced they’ll be able to fix their phone. The best part is that when they inevitably fail due to being untrained and unskilled, they can simply blame the device and say it isn’t repair friendly. </p>
