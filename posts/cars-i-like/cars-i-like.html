       <h2>Sports Cars:</h2>
       <p>Sports cars is the easiest section because they're made for people like me. Companies don't have to make as many performance compromises in the sports car department. Compromises made here fall into categories such as price, comfort, and daily livability. I'm going to separate sports cars and super cars because there is a point where a vehicle can't be used for daily tasks because of even higher compromises in those categories.</p>
